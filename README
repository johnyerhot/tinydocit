TinyDoc.it

Created by Michael Wagner <notesgeek@gmail.com> and John Yerhot <john@yerhot.org>
for the 2010 Rails Rumble.

Basically, it is a URL shortener for documents.  Documents, meaning only PDFs right
now. Upload the PDF and it get sent into a queue where we slice and dice it into
images, which you can then browse in a web page on your computer, phone, whatever.
You also get a tiny url that you can easily share with people.
